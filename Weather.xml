    <title>Feature: Weather derivatives
	</title>
	<content>
		Weather derivatives emerged in the mid 1990s, evolving out of insurance derivatives and the alternative risk transfer market. Weather derivatives are an important instrument as their structures seek to manage volume risk rather than pure price risk. They are also interesting as the underlying is not directly tradeable.
		In this paper the economics of weather risk, including the impact on earnings and the key characteristics of weather risk products, are outlined. In part 2, the major types of weather risk derivatives are identified. In part 3, the pricing of weather derivatives is examined.

    <title>Mayor declares weather disaster
	</title>
	<content>
		The disaster declaration was signed Monday by Mayor John Tyler Hammons after the area was hit with a blizzard last week.
		Disasters were also declared after ice storms hit the area in 2007 and 2008, Moore said.
		The declaration for the blizzard of 2009 will have no effect unless the president issues a disaster declaration for the state, which will likely be in the next two weeks if it happens, Moore said.
		Whether the presidential declaration is issued depends on the amount of damage statewide, said Jeff Smith, Muskogee County Emergency Management director. For the state declaration, damage would have to total about $4 million.

		This interactive graphic above created by Nasa, shows how the Earth has changed over time (credit: Nasa)
		However, there are expectations that while 2015 will become the warmest year on record, much of that may be due to the unseasonable El Nino event rather than a rapid acceleration in climate change.
		Others have also expressed doubts over the reliability of global temperature data.
		In April, London-based think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, announced it was launching an inquiry into the integrity of official surface temperature records.

    <title>The strength and quality of climate perceptions
	</title>
	<content>
		An organization's climate is a valuable resource for organizational effectiveness because it influences employees' commitment to the organization (e.g. [5] Carr et al. , 2003). However, research has shown that individual climate perceptions may vary among group members who share a similar environment (e.g. [14] Klein et al. , 2001). Employees may perceive their environment differently because they "draw on what they experience as their own backgrounds, their 'selves' when making sense of organizational events" ([20] Peterson and Smith, 2000, p. 110). Additionally, employees may develop different climate perceptions in weak organizational environments. In weak, as opposed to strong, organizational environments, there are ambiguous organizational values and few behavioral norms (e.g. [17] Mischel, 1977), which allows for individual differences in expectations and perceptions. The extent to which group members differ in their climate perceptions has been referred to as climate strength.

    <title>Dramatic Climate Change Is Unpredictable
	</title>
	<content>
		The fear that global temperature can change very quickly and cause dramatic climate changes that may have a disastrous impact on many countries and populations is great around the world. But what causes climate change and is it possible to predict future climate change? New research from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen shows that it may be due to an accumulation of different chaotic influences and as a result would be difficult to predict. The results have just been published in Geophysical Research Letters.
